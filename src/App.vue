        The COVID-19 pandemic is having an unprecedented impact on the
        Philadelphia region. Following the announcement of Philadelphia’s first
        confirmed case on March 10, schools were closed on March 16 and a
        stay-at-home order began on March 23. The order imposed a number of
        public health restrictions on the city’s residents designed to slow the
        spread of infections and prevent the crisis from overwhelming the city’s
        healthcare capacity. These restrictions have had an immediate and
        profound effect on the local economy, with non-essential businesses
        forced to close temporarily and sudden and enormous job losses. While
        not yet reflected in official statistics, the reality of the impact so
        far indicates the city is in a recession. As the economy contracts, the
        City’s tax revenues will decline, particularly those most sensitive to
        economic conditions, such as wage and sales taxes.
      </p>

      <p>
        This report provides an estimate of the potential impact of the COVID-19
        crisis on the City’s revenues over the next year. Like other cities
        across the country, a great deal of uncertainty surrounds Philadelphia’s
        future from both a public health and economic perspective. The ultimate
        economic toll of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on a range of items,
        including the success of public health efforts, the federal government’s
        policy response, and the ability to safely re-open the city’s economy.
        Given this uncertainty, the Controller’s Office analyzed two possible
        scenarios, moderate and severe, and their associated tax revenue
        impacts. The impact is presented relative to projections in the City’s
        <a
          href="https://www.phila.gov/media/20200324135241/FYP-FullLayout-Final_ONLINE_3.23.pdf"
          target="blank_"
        >FY21-FY25 Five Year Financial Plan</a>, as proposed on
        March 5. The projections examine the short-term impact to the City’s
        finances, focusing on fiscal year 2020 (FY20), which ends on June 30,
        2020, and fiscal year 2021 (FY21).
      </p>

      <p>
        Relative to the March baseline, the Controller’s Office estimates a
        combined tax revenue shortfall in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 ranging
        from $344M (-4.0 percent) in the moderate scenario to $647M (-7.5
        percent) in the severe scenario. The differences relative to the March
        baseline are summarized by major tax in the table below. This report
        focuses only on the City’s major taxes and does not include costs
        associated with the City’s response to the emergency, the effects of
        state or federal aid, or the impacts to the City’s non-tax revenue
        sources. The two scenarios considered, which are described in more
        detail in the following section, are designed to estimate the effects of
        the City’s current stay-at-home order on the local economy. In both
        scenarios, the economic effects persist throughout calendar year 2021 as
        unemployment and local businesses slowly recover to pre-crisis levels.
        Moving forward, the Controller’s Office will continue to closely monitor
        policy responses and public health forecasts, particularly the
        possibility of a second wave of infections, and will update the
        projections in this analysis in the coming months.

      <h2>Methodology and Assumptions</h2>
      <hr class="titlebar" />

      <p>
        This analysis considers the impacts of COVID-19 on the City’s revenues
        under a moderate scenario and a more severe, extended recession
        scenario.
        <a
          href="#ref1"
          id="fn1"
          title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text."
        >[1]&nbsp;</a> The assumptions for these scenarios were informed by recent
        forecasts made by economists, financial experts, and public sector
        institutions.
        <a
          href="#ref2"
          id="fn2"
          title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text."
        >[2]&nbsp;</a> Although real-time indicators of the economic impact of
        the pandemic are limited, available data sources were used when
        possible. Forecasts have changed week to week, with the majority of
        recent forecasts predicting a global recession with a recovery that
        could last through 2021.
        <a
          href="#ref3"
          id="fn3"
          title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text."
        >[3]&nbsp;</a> Both the moderate and severe scenarios in this
        analysis assume that the economic impacts of COVID-19 will last through
        FY21, but to different degrees of severity. The scenarios considered
        are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Moderate Impact</b>: A more limited scenario resulting from a relatively
          short-term recession in which the economy experiences a brief,
          six-month shock and recovers close to pre-crisis levels by the first
          quarter of calendar year 2021. While uncertain, this scenario would be
          more likely if the city’s stay-at-home order is relatively short,
          lasting between 8 and 10 weeks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Severe Impact</b>: An extended scenario in which the economy
          experiences a more significant six-month shock, followed by a slower
          period of recovery that extends through the end of calendar year 2021
          for the hardest hit industries. This scenario would be more likely if
          public health efforts require the city’s current stay-at-home order to
          last into June or beyond, or if subsequent infection outbreaks require
          future shutdowns.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For both scenarios, the Controller’s Office estimated specific,
        industry-level contractions for each tax using existing historical data
        as well as economic trends that have emerged since the start of the
        COVID-19 social distancing measures. As some industries are more heavily
        affected by mandated social distancing policies than others, the impacts
        of COVID-19 were applied industry-by-industry under both scenarios.
        Across Pennsylvania, job losses have already impacted some industries
        more than others. Since the second week of March, the Commonwealth has
        received more than 1.5 million unemployment claims.
        <a
          href="#ref4"
          id="fn4"
          title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text."
        >[4]&nbsp;</a> Industries that
        could not shift workers to telecommuting, such as restaurants,
        construction, social services, retail, and manufacturing, had the
        highest rates of job loss in March.
        <a
          href="#ref5"
          id="fn5"
          title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text."
        >[5]&nbsp;</a> The two scenarios assume that these
        industries will be harder hit by the economic impacts of COVID-19, while
        industries with more work-from-home capabilities will be more immune to
        the effects of a recession. Real-time data for hourly employees
        published by Homebase,
        <a
          href="#ref6"
          id="fn6"
          title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text."
        >[6]&nbsp;</a> a scheduling and time-card company for local
        businesses, also indicates that these sectors have been adversely
        affected by the pandemic so far. A combination of unemployment claims,
        Homebase data, and a number of other publicly available sources,
        <a
          href="#ref7"
          id="fn7"
          title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text."
        >[7]&nbsp;</a> were
        used to estimate contractions on a sector-by-sector basis.
      </p>

      <p>
        The quarterly contractions assumed for each tax are shown in the figure
        below. The City’s business taxes, BIRT and the net profits tax, are
        omitted from the figure due to changes in their filing dates leading to
        large monthly changes from the baseline scenario. These taxes, as well
        as the other major taxes, are discussed in detail in the following
        section.

      <h2>Tax Revenue Impacts</h2>
      <hr class="titlebar" />

      <p>
        The economic impact of COVID-19 will affect the city’s taxes
        differently. For example, wage, BIRT, and sales taxes are assumed to be
        more severely impacted than the real estate tax due to suppressed
        business activity and an increase in unemployment in the Philadelphia
        region. In addition to economic effects, the City moved its BIRT and net
        profits tax filing dates from April to July to match federal changes,
        shifting hundreds of millions in tax revenue from FY20 to FY21. The
        following sections summarize the projections for each of the City’s
        major taxes.
      </p>

      <!-- Wage -->
      <h3>Wage & Earnings Tax</h3>
      <p>
        The City’s wage tax is its single largest tax revenue source
        <a
          href="#ref8"
          id="fn8"
          title="Jump back to footnote 8 in the text."
        >[8]&nbsp;</a> and is
        particularly sensitive to unemployment in the city. With job losses
        reaching historic levels, a large contraction in the City’s wage tax is
        expected in the short term. The largest contractions are expected in the
        restaurants, leisure and hospitality, and retail sectors. In fiscal year
        2019, these sectors accounted for about 12 percent of the City’s total
        wage tax collections. The City’s health and social services sector
        accounted for the largest fraction (21 percent), which should help
        mitigate the revenue losses to some degree. Job losses in this sector
        are expected to be less severe, although the industry has already seen
        impacts from the cancellation of non-essential and elective services
        during the stay-at-home order.
        <a
          href="#ref9"
          id="fn9"
          title="Jump back to footnote 9 in the text."
        >[9]&nbsp;</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Importantly, the analysis presented here does not account for wage tax
        refunds for non-resident employees who were forced to work from home
        during the stay-at-home order. With non-residents representing about 40
        percent of the wage tax base, the City could see additional declines in
        its wage tax collections in FY21, as large as $30M for a stay-at-home
        order that lasts through June 2020.
        <a
          href="#ref10"
          id="fn10"
          title="Jump back to footnote 10 in the text."
        >[10]&nbsp;</a> However, the impact remains highly
        uncertain at this time and should be treated as an illustration of
        potential scale, rather than an exact forecast.
      </p>

      <!-- Sales -->
      <h3>Sales Tax</h3>
      <p>
        With the majority of the city’s businesses closed, the retail and
        restaurant industries are experiencing immediate and substantial losses.
        These two industries account for the largest portions of the City’s
        sales tax revenue, with retail accounting for 32 percent and restaurants
        accounting for 15 percent in FY18. As such, the analysis assumes a drop
        in sales tax collections for these sectors of 50 percent in the moderate
        scenario and 70 percent in the severe scenario during the fourth quarter
        of FY20. Collections are assumed to decline by 30 percent (moderate) and
        50 percent (severe) for other sectors. Sales tax revenue improves
        quarter by quarter, with the recovery delayed by a quarter in the severe
        case relative to the moderate scenario.
      </p>

      <!-- Business Taxes -->
      <h3>Business Taxes</h3>
      <p>
        Business tax collections for tax year 2019, typically due in April 2020,
        are not expected to be widely affected by the current crisis, with
        larger economic effects appearing in FY21 (April 2021). The City shifted
        its filing dates for BIRT and the net profits tax from April 2020 in
        FY20 to July 2020 in FY21. As the amount of businesses who will pay
        these taxes early remains uncertain, the projections assume the entirety
        of the revenue from April will be shifted to July in order to gauge the
        maximum effect on the City’s short-term cash flow. For BIRT, this
        amounts to about $380M moving from FY20 to FY21.
      </p>
      <p>
        To estimate the economic effects on BIRT and net profits collections,
        the analysis assumes a 5 percent (moderate) and 10 percent (severe)
        decline from baseline for July 2020 collections and a larger 10 percent
        (moderate) and 15 percent (severe) decline for the April 2021. These
        reductions are consistent with the magnitude of revenue declines in the
        years following the Great Recession.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, it is worth noting that BIRT collections are particularly
        challenging to forecast due to a number of policy and accounting
        complexities. For example, while businesses are typically required to
        pre-pay their tax liability for the current tax year based on the
        previous year’s liability, the regulations allow companies to pre-pay a
        lower amount if there is reason to believe the current year’s tax
        liability will be lower.
        <a
          href="#ref11"
          id="fn11"
          title="Jump back to footnote 11 in the text."
        >[11]&nbsp;</a> To the extent that more businesses use this
        option than expected, additional revenue could shift from July 2020 to
        April 2021.
      </p>

      <!-- Beverage Tax -->
      <h3>Beverage Tax</h3>
      <p>
        Similar to the sales tax, the COVID-19 crisis is expected to negatively
        impact beverage tax collections due to effects on the restaurant and
        dining industry. The analysis projects a 20 percent (moderate) and 40
        percent (severe) decline from baseline in FY20 Q4, with the recovery
        delayed by a quarter in the severe case. With restaurants expected to be
        one of the last sectors to fully re-open, these effects are projected to
        last through the end of FY21.
      </p>

      <!-- Parking Tax -->
      <h3>Parking Tax</h3>
      <p>
        Vehicle traffic has declined sharply during the stay-at-home order,
        <a
          href="#ref12"
          id="fn12"
          title="Jump back to footnote 12 in the text."
        >[12]&nbsp;</a>
        leading to lower estimates for parking tax collections. Collections are
        projected to decline by 30 percent (moderate) and 50 percent (severe)
        from the baseline projections in FY20 Q4. With social distancing
        measures likely to continue into 2021 and the City’s tourism industry
        adversely affected by the pandemic, declines are projected to continue
        through the end of FY21.
      </p>

      <!-- Amusement Tax -->
      <h3>Amusement Tax</h3>
      <p>
        The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have a large effect on the City’s
        amusement tax, which is imposed on admission fees to events like
        concerts, movies, athletic events, and night clubs. The City’s current
        social distancing measures prohibit such events, and even if those
        measures are relaxed, the projections assume residents will largely shy
        away from large gatherings for some time. Collections are projected to
        decline by 70 percent (moderate) and 90 percent (severe) from the
        baseline projections in FY20 Q4, with large reductions continuing
        through FY21.
      </p>

      <!-- Realty Transfer Tax -->
      <h3>Realty Transfer Tax</h3>
      <p>
        With the City’s housing market remaining active in recent years, revenue
        from the tax on residential and commercial real estate transfers has
        been historically high. In fact, March’s collections total of $47M was a
        record high. Unlike the Great Recession, the current crisis is not
        housing-driven, making the effects of the pandemic on transfer tax
        revenue particularly uncertain. In both scenarios considered, the
        projections assume a 30 percent drop in collections in FY20 Q4, driven
        by the stay-at-home order and declines of 5 (moderate) to 10 percent
        (severe) from baseline projections continuing into 2021 due to ongoing
        social distancing measures. These declines are consistent with early
        indicators of the impact of the stay-at-home order on Philadelphia’s
        housing market.

          title="Jump back to footnote 13 in the text."
        >[13]&nbsp;</a>
      </p>

      <!-- Real Estate Tax -->
      <h3>Real Estate Tax</h3>
      <p>
        The analysis assumes no impact on the City’s real estate tax collections
        in FY20 or FY21. Real estate tax collections are based on assessments
        that are released about a year prior to the filing date. As such, the
        economic impact on the tax will be delayed. As the current crisis begins
        to affect the City’s housing market, the City’s property tax collections
        would be first impacted in FY22, which are based on assessments released
        in April 2021.

      <hr class="titlebar" />

      <p>
        The revenue shortfalls projected in this analysis, a combined total of
        $344M in the moderate scenario and $647M in the severe scenario for FY20
        and FY21, represent an unprecedented fiscal challenge for the City.
        While the exact economic impact remains unknown, it is clear that the
        current emergency will have an enormous impact on the City’s finances at
        a time when a historic number of residents are unemployed and the need
        for City services has never been greater. As the City faces these
        challenges, it is more important than ever that the City operates
        efficiently and effectively and is truly able to do more with less. As
        the City perseveres through the current crisis, the Controller’s Office
        remains committed to these goals and ensuring that the City and its
        residents make it through this crisis stronger than ever.
